# Omic Wastewater Surveillance

**Wastewater surveillance** is attracting extensive public attention during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as a passive monitoring system to complement clinical and genomic surveillance activities. There are several methods and protocols already in place that effectively facilitate the detection and quantification of viral RNA in wastewater samples, and concentrations in wastewater have been shown to correlate with trends in reported cases. However, and despite the promise of deeper insights that could be gleaned from sequencing wastewater samples, there are few efforts globally that take wastewater sequencing data into consideration. 

**Main goal** of the Wastewater Surveillance Working Group is to address this gap by promoting best practises and establishing a forum towards proposing effective bioinformatics solutions.

The Working Group comprises of more than 60 members from across 15 countries in Europe with active interest in wastewater surveillance, and work together in addressing the following challenges;
- (a) **defining a systematic approach to metadata standardisation and data harmonisation**, making it possible to combine and compare datasets, and consequently promoting a more universal use and reuse of the data,
- (b) **identifying bioinformatics solutions** tailored to the inherent challenges of wastewater sequencing data and enabling decision-making processes, and
- (c) **exchanging best practises** and protocols for effective wastewater sequence data management.


## Scope

The goal of this repository is to contain the information, processes, and ultimately capture the best practices for genomics wastewater surveillance, based on the discussions held within the [ELIXIR Wastewater Surveillance Working Group](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/partners?activeTab=Working%20groups)
